<b> Proving that there must exist communal resources for free-will to exist. </b>

Does there exist a set of assets that are commonly owned? Yes, any form of interaction between individual's requires a medium. This medium can not be owned/controlled by the other, otherwise the two entities are in-fact the same entity. The two objects would be directly connected with each other, and therefore there would be no region that distinguishes each object. Therefore for two objects to have free-will there must be a third part, a barrier that separates each individual. Hence the medium between the two objects must not be owned by either, it could be considered a communal resource. This medium is necessary for free-will. 

If control over the medium begins to become controlled by both or either party, then the two objects start to become one. As there is no longer a region that separates either party. If the medium is controlled disproportionally by one party then the dominant party dictates the terms of interaction. The dominant party dictates the use of the medium. Since there is no region that distinguishes the two objects then they are in fact the same entity. The weak party would be the subordinate of the dominant party. The weak party would no longer have free will.
